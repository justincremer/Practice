# Player Notes

Name: Mylie Schmidt
Times : 5AM, 8AM, 2PM, 8PM, 11 PM
Times Played: 13

=================================

# Summary

Mylie Schmidt was present during 13 instances of significant roullette losses 
- the same times Billy Jones was working the roullete tables.  It is obvious to 
presume, the two were working together and are indeed the culprits at hand.
I can't really blame Billy though, I mean look at those shifts.
